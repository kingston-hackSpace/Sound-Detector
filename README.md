# Sound Detector

DESCRIPTION
- 
The SparkFun Sound Detector is a microphone-based sensor that detects the presence and level of sound
in the environment.

*It’s NOT a sound recorder—* it only measures sound intensity (volume) and provides a corresponding signal.

FEATURES
- 
- GATE: Processes DIGITAL signals that indicates whether the sound level is above or below a certain threshold.
In other words, it works like an on/off switch to detect sound vs. no sound.

- ENVELOPE: Processes ANALOG signals that represent ambient sound volume. In other words, it allow us to monitor sound amplitud. 

TUTORIAL
-
The following tutorial demonstrates how to use the Sound-Detector in its two modes (gate and envelop), visualizing the incoming data in the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor.
