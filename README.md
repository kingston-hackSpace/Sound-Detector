# Sound Detector

The SparkFun Sound Detector is a microphone-based sensor designed to detect the presence and intensity of sound in its surroundings.

Note : *It does NOT provide decibel readings, so it’s not suitable for precise noise level measurements.*

Note : *It’s NOT a sound recorder—* It only measures sound intensity (volume) and provides a corresponding signal.

### HOW IT WORKS:

The sensor’s microphone converts air-pressure variations (sound waves) into electrical signals, which are then processed to indicate sound intensity. This processed signal is available in two forms:

- GATE: Processes DIGITAL signals that indicate whether the sound level is above or below a certain threshold.
In other words, it works like an on/off switch to detect sound vs. no sound.

- ENVELOPE: Processes ANALOG signals that represent ambient sound volume. In other words, it allow us to monitor sound amplitud.
